# A Webpack Vue.js Laravel REST API Blog

A Webpack Vue.js Laravel REST API Blog application for Blog Management

- This application is a frontend part of an LAravel API seperated from Laravel.
- All the code is written by me.

## Tips

- Don't forget to change the API URL in src/http/http.js into your API URL
- Upload the Laravel API in my repository to run this frontend application
- To create a Vue.js project with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) you need to execute these commands :

```bash
 #If vue-cli is not installed in your machine
  $ npm install -g vue-cli
  $ vue init webpack my-project
  $ cd my-project
  $ npm install
  $ npm run dev
```

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
Copy dist/index.html and bring out from dist and copy also dist/ folder into your website root directory. Done.

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
